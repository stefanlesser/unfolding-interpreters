> *“Design is often thought of as a process of synthesis, a process of putting together things, a process of combination.*
> 
> According to this view, a whole is created by putting together parts. The parts come first: and the form of the whole comes second.
> 
> *But it is impossible to form anything which has the character of nature by adding preformed parts.*
> 
> When parts are modular and made before the whole, by definition then, they are identical, and it is impossible for every part to be unique, according to its position in the whole.”
